Anyway, it was the Saturday of the football game with Saxon Hall. The game with Saxon Hall
was supposed to be a very big deal around Pencey. It was the last game of the year, and you were
supposed to commit suicide or something if old Pencey didn't win. I remember around three
o'clock that afternoon I was standing way the hell up on top of Thomsen Hill, right next to this
crazy cannon that was in the Revolutionary War and all. You could see the whole field from
there, and you could see the two teams bashing each other all over the place. You couldn't see the
grandstand too hot, but you could hear them all yelling, deep and terrific on the Pencey side,
because practically the whole school except me was there, and scrawny and faggy on the Saxon
Hall side, because the visiting team hardly ever brought many people with them.
There were never many girls at all at the football games
